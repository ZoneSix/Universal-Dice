# Universal-Dice
Java GUI utility to simulate virtual dice made in NetBeans IDE 8.0.2

This utility started out as a school assignment to render simple graphics to the GUI in Java.
I later distributed it to my website. The second assigment we got was to built on our existing program
but make the dice in to an object. I also built on top of the existing program in the meantime witch
GUI optimizations to make it more user-friendly, support up to 5 dice for various games and ect,
leading up to the second version.

You have the right to use it for your own personal use, download the source, look at it, improve it and give me feedback.
But DO NOT distribute it without my permission or propper credits!
